title: "SWATplusR 0.2.4: Running SWAT2012 and SWAT+ Projects in R"

abstract: "The `SWATplusR` package provides tools to link existing SWAT2012 and SWAT+ models with your modeling workflows in R. `SWATplusR` enables you to execute SWAT simulations and to control all relevant parameters of a SWAT simulation, such as changes in model parameters, the simulation periods and time steps, or the simulated variables that should be returned to R. The central goal of `SWATplusR` is to return simulation results in a *tidy* format to facilitate an easy implementation of SWAT simulations, together with other R packages into clean and efficient R programming workflows. To efficiently handle large SWAT projects with large numbers of model evaluations and/or large simulation outputs, `SWATplusR` provides parallel computation and incremental saving and selective loading of simulation results into and from SQLite data bases."

# Installation

`SWATplusR` is currently under development. You can install an unreleased version of `SWATplusR` from the package's GitHub repository.

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# If you do not have the package devtools installed
install.packages("devtools")

# If access is denied, then the repository might be still set to private
# In that case, please contact me (c.schuerz@posteo.org).
devtools::install_github("chrisschuerz/SWATplusR")
```


# Functionality and workflow

The functionality of `SWATplusR` is reduced to a few essential functions that maintain the link between the SWAT project on the local hard drive and the R environment. With `load_demo()` you can retrieve demo data sets of SWAT projects, calibration data, and shape files of the demo catchment. With `run_swat2012()` and `run_swat2012()` you can run a SWAT model located in a local project folder and return simulation outputs to R that were defined with `define_output()`. Simulation results can be saved incrementally to an SQLite data base when a `save_file` is defined in `run_swat*()`. With `load_swat_run()` all or selected parts of the simulation results stored in the data base can be loaded back to R. `scan_swat_run()` scans the content of saved simulations and returns meta data on the saved content.

# Getting started with `SWATplusR`

You can explore the basic functionality of `SWATplusR` in the [Get started](https://chrisschuerz.github.io/SWATplusR/articles/SWATplusR.html#loading-demos) section. There you can learn the following basics:

The [Articles](https://chrisschuerz.github.io/SWATplusR/articles/) section is a collection of tutorials for typical topics on SWAT modeling. Here you can learn how to use `SWATplusR` in combination with other R packages to perform tasks such as:

- Parameter sensitivity analysis [>>](https://chrisschuerz.github.io/SWATplusR/articles/par_sensitivity.html)
- Model parameter optimization [>>](https://chrisschuerz.github.io/SWATplusR/articles/par_optim.html)
- Parameter sampling and model calibration [>>](https://chrisschuerz.github.io/SWATplusR/articles/par_sampl_calib.html)
- Visualization >>

The Articles section will be updated in the future with further topics that can be relevant for any modeling workflow with `SWATplusR`.
