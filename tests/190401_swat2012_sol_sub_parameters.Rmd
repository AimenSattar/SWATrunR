## Define parameters

The following parameter set resulted in an undesired behavior when it was implemented in a SWAT201 simulation using `SWATplusR` and empty output files were returned. Some testing showed that the alteration of parameters in the \*.sub and \*.sol input files resulted in the described issue. To analyze the problem, subsets of \*.sub and \*.sol were selected for the simulation with SWAT2012.

```{r}
par_issue <- tibble("GW_DELAY.gw|change = absval" = c(30, 450),

## Selected test runs
### Debug with \*.sub parameters

For debugging only the \*.sub parameters were selected from the defined parameter set.
```{r}
par_sub <- select(par_issue, contains(".sub"))
```

```{r}
path_2012 <- "C:/swat2012_demo"

q_sub <- run_swat2012(project_path = path_2012, 
                      output = define_output(file = "rch", 
                                             variable = "FLOW_OUT", 
                                             unit = 3),
                      parameter = par_sub, 
                      start_date = "2000-01-01", 
                      end_date = "2007-12-31", 
                      years_skip = 3, 
                      n_thread = 2)
```

An issue with different file lengths of \*.sub files was encountered. Problem was fixed in `write_par_list()` L46. Test was sucessful.

```{r}
q_sub$simulation$FLOW_OUT
```

### Debug with \*.sol parameters

For debugging only the \*.sol parameters were selected from the defined parameter set.
```{r}
par_sol <- select(par_issue, contains(".sol"))
```

```{r, eval=F}
q_sol <- run_swat2012(project_path = path_2012, 
                      output = define_output(file = "rch", 
                                             variable = "FLOW_OUT", 
                                             unit = 3),
                      parameter = par_sol, 
                      start_date = "2000-01-01", 
                      end_date = "2007-12-31", 
                      years_skip = 3, 
                      n_thread = 2)
```

The issue for soil parameters resulted from different numbers of soil layers. In the code the number of soil layers that are modified were defined by the first \*.sol file. If any further \*.sol file has fewer layers, NA values are written in the updated files that cause an error. In any case, defining the number of layers by the first soil is highly problematic and was thus fixed. Now the number of layers is kept flexible for every HRU. 

Additionally, using `'change = absval'` for `'SOL_Z.sol'` is problematic. In that case the same soil depth is assigned to all soil layers of an HRU and the consequence is an error in the simulation. Thus, soil layers should be either changed with `'change = abschg'` or `'change = pctchg'`. Alternatively, soil layers can be modified layer-wise by adding `'| layer = 1'` or similar constraints to the parameter name.

Both parameter definition examples below work for instance with the demo SWAT2012 setup:

```{r}
par_sol <- tibble("SOL_AWC.sol|change = absval" = c(0.01, 0.5), 
                  "SOL_Z.sol|change = abschg" = c(0, 1000))

q_sol <- run_swat2012(project_path = path_2012, 
                      output = define_output(file = "rch", 
                                             variable = "FLOW_OUT", 
                                             unit = 3),
                      parameter = par_sol, 
                      start_date = "2000-01-01", 
                      end_date = "2007-12-31", 
                      years_skip = 3, 
                      n_thread = 2)
```

```{r}
par_sol <- tibble("SOL_AWC.sol|change = absval" = c(0.01, 0.5), 
                  "sol_z1::SOL_Z.sol|change = absval| layer = 1" = c(50, 500),
                  "sol_z2::SOL_Z.sol|change = absval| layer = 2" = c(600, 1000),
                  "sol_z3::SOL_Z.sol|change = absval| layer = 3" = c(750, 1500))

q_sol <- run_swat2012(project_path = path_2012, 
                      output = define_output(file = "rch", 
                                             variable = "FLOW_OUT", 
                                             unit = 3),
                      parameter = par_sol, 
                      start_date = "2000-01-01", 
                      end_date = "2007-12-31", 
                      years_skip = 3, 
                      n_thread = 2)
```


```{r}
q_sol$simulation$FLOW_OUT
```


## Test run with the initial parameter set

Finally the entire initial parameter set is tested here considering however the necessary corrections for the parameter `'SOL_Z.sol'`:

```{r}

par_issue <- par_issue %>% 
  rename(., `SOL_Z.sol|change = abschg` = `SOL_Z.sol|change = absval`)

q_test <- run_swat2012(project_path = path_2012, 
                      output = define_output(file = "rch", 
                                             variable = "FLOW_OUT", 
                                             unit = 3),
                      parameter = par_issue, 
                      start_date = "2000-01-01", 
                      end_date = "2007-12-31", 
                      years_skip = 3, 
                      n_thread = 2)
```

```{r}
q_test
```
